# About GitArchived
GitArchived is an open-source project committed to serving as a backup for all kinds of repositories. The concept originated when right after [the famous browser extension Wappalyzer went closed source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37236746). Their main repository went private and it took some time for people to find an updated fork reflecting the latest changes.

The main objective of GitArchived is to keep up-to-date snapshots of all repositories by periodically downloading their latest version.
