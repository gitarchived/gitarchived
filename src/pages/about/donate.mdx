# A small tip can make a big difference

GitArchived is a completely **free and open-source** service, and it will always remain so. However, sustaining it **requires financial support**. The server, storage, domain, and other essential services are all funded by the project maintainer out of pocket. To **keep** GitArchived **up and running** smoothly, we rely on the generosity of users like you.
