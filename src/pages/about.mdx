# Born from a necessity...

The concept behind GitArchived originated when Valerio Clemenzi and Sean stumbled upon [this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37236746) post on HackerNews, revealing that the [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) project—a site/extension designed to identify the technologies used by websites—had transitioned to a closed-source model. Given the challenge of finding an updated fork reflecting the latest commits, the duo conceived the idea of establishing a repository where repositories could be securely preserved. Approximately six months later, this notion materialized into the development of GitArchived, culminating in the release of its beta version after about a week.

## Philosophy

GitArchived is a fully open-source, non-profit endeavor committed to serving as a sanctuary for repositories. Our objective is to curate an expansive registry encompassing diverse repositories, recognizing the significance of each contribution. We firmly believe that every repository merits inclusion in GitArchived, safeguarding them from potential future adversities.
